## Disclosure

This portfolio and documentation was developed with assistance from 
Claude (Anthropic PBC's AI). I use AI as a learning tool and technical 
guide while building hands-on skills. All infrastructure is built 
and operated by me - the AI helps explain concepts, troubleshoot 
issues, and structure documentation.

I believe it is morally and ethically responsible to disclose the tool(s) I am using
in this journey of learning greater skills in the IT world.
